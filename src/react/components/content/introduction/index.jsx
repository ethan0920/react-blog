      I am a <span id='content-intro-important'>passionate web developer</span> who is constantly wanting to learn new things. I enjoy building different websites and coming up with cool ideas for projects. I created this site to set out and start writing about my learning journey and sharing things that I have learned as well. Oh I am also born and raised in Canada 🍁 ey. 😄
